# This is the Sample

## Introduction
- Testing framework [GoogleTest for C++](https://google.github.io/googletest/)
- [C++ Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/cpp)

## Lecture:
- ch4: polymorphism
- ch4: Linkedlist

## Run into error with g++:
- Please use the command to run each file since they use newer version of C++ (eg: c++11, c++13, c++17)
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 ch5_recursion_problem_solving.cpp -o driver
```
## Exam1:
1. OOP (Concept Only)
2. Linked List:
    - Single (InsertAtBeginning (or the Ends), Update, Delete, IsEmpty )
    - Double(InsertAtBeginning (or the Ends), Update, Delete, IsEmpty )
    - Head, Tails concepts

3. Recursive:
    - Basic Recursive concept:
        - Base Case and recursive case
    - Methods:
        
4. Polymorphism:
    - Class and Object: getter and setter, private, public, protected (concept + code)
    - virtual class? (Concept + code)
    - Inheritance? (Concept + Code)
    - Multiple inheritance? (Concept + Code)
    
5. Exception Handling (Concept+ Code):
    - try block
    - catch block
    - thrown statement

6. Sorted List (Concept + Code):
    - Linked List Implementation (Concept + Code)
    - Array Implementation (Concept + Code)

7. Stack (CC):
    - ADT Stack
    - Stack Node functions (Push, Pop, Peek, Isempty)
