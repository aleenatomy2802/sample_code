# Online Class Etiquette and Guidelines

1. **Punctuality:** Log in to the virtual classroom a few minutes before the scheduled start time. Late entries can disrupt the flow of the class.

2. **Camera Use:** Keep your camera on during class to facilitate a more engaging and interactive session. If you must turn it off, please notify the instructor in advance.

3. **Microphone Management:** Mute your microphone when not speaking to minimize background noise and distractions.

4. **Active Participation:** Participate actively in discussions and activities. Use the 'Raise Hand' feature if you wish to contribute or ask a question.

5. **Respectful Communication:** Use respectful and appropriate language at all times. Address both your peers and instructors courteously.

6. **Digital Etiquette:** Avoid multitasking and stay focused on the class. Refrain from using your phone or browsing other websites during class.

7. **Background and Dress Code:** Maintain a neutral and non-distracting background. Dress as you would for an in-person class to maintain professionalism.

8. **Assignment Submission:** Submit all assignments and homework by the due dates provided. If you're facing difficulties, communicate with your instructor ahead of time.

9. **Confidentiality:** Do not share class recordings, materials, or personal information about classmates without permission.

10. **Technical Preparedness:** Ensure your device, internet connection, and any required software are working properly before class.

Adhering to these rules will help create a positive and effective learning environment for everyone. Feel free to adjust or expand these guidelines to better suit the needs and nature of your specific online class.
