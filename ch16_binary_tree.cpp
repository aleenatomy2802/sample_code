Tree data structures are fundamental in computer science, used for organizing data in a hierarchical manner. There are several types of tree data structures, each with its unique properties and use cases. Here are some of the most commonly used types:

1. **Binary Tree**: A tree where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

2. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree where for each node, all elements in the left subtree are less than the node, and all elements in the right subtree are greater. This property enables efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

3. **AVL Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree where the height of the two child subtrees of any node differ by no more than one. If at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this property.

4. **Red-Black Tree**: Another type of self-balancing binary search tree where each node contains an extra bit for denoting the color of the node, either red or black. It enforces balancing constraints that ensure the tree remains balanced, leading to good worst-case guarantees for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations.

5. **B-Tree**: A self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time. It's widely used in databases and filesystems.

6. **B+ Tree**: A type of B-tree where all records are stored at the leaf level of the tree; thus, the leaf nodes form a linked list. It's particularly useful for range queries and is extensively used in databases and filesystems.

7. **Trie (Prefix Tree)**: A tree-like data structure that proves efficient for dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings. It is used for retrieving a key in a dataset of strings with a common prefix.

8. **Segment Tree**: A tree data structure used for storing information about intervals or segments. It allows querying which segments contain a given point efficiently. It's often used in competitive programming and geometric queries.

9. **Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)**: A data structure that provides efficient methods for calculating the prefix sum of a mutable array. It's used in scenarios where there's a need for frequent updates as well as prefix sum calculations.

10. **Splay Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree with the additional property that recently accessed elements are quick to access again. It performs basic operations such as insertion, lookup, and removal in amortized O(log n) time.

11. **Heap**: Although not a tree in the traditional sense of a hierarchical data structure, heaps are often implemented as binary trees. They are used to implement priority queues, with the heap property ensuring that the parent node is either greater than or equal to (in a max heap) or less than or equal to (in a min heap) its child nodes.

12. **Suffix Tree**: A compressed trie containing all the suffixes of the given text as their keys and positions in the text as their values. Suffix trees are used in various string operations and pattern matching problems.

13. **N-ary Tree**: A tree where each node can have at most N children. It's a generalization of a binary tree for cases where more than two child nodes are required.

14. **Quadtree**: Used primarily in two-dimensional spatial data analysis, a quadtree is a tree where each internal node has exactly four children. It's commonly used in image processing, geographical information systems (GIS), and more.

15. **Octree**: Similar to a quadtree but for three-dimensional space. Each internal node has eight children. It's used in 3D graphics, spatial indexing, and other applications involving 3D space.

Each of these tree structures is designed to solve specific problems, such as enhancing search efficiency, maintaining sorted data, handling multi-dimensional data, or optimizing for space and update operations.
